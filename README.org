#+title: C++ D*Lite implementation using boost library
#+author: Miguel Arpa Perozo

* Compilation 
  In order to compile the project execute at the root of the project
  in a shell :
  #+begin_src bash 
  make 
  #+end_src

* Getting Started 
  To execute the program : 
  1. Type ~50~ for rows and columns input.
  2. Type ~1~ for obstacle number.
  3. Now you are running a step by step scenario. The ~1~ represents
     the obstacles, and the ~2~ the robot path. Inside this scenario
     you can :
     - Type ~c~ to continue.
     - Type ~d~ to add a disturbance (try-it!)
     - Type ~m~ to randomly modify the position of the obstacles
       (useful when you have a large number of obstacles). 
* Tasks 
** TODO Write documentation.   
** TODO Clean debug comments. 
** TODO Fix warning messages. 
** TODO New version using objects ?
